# Hello, thank you for your interest in node-red-contrib-tcp-tls

Please note that this functionality has been merged into core Node-RED as of [2.2.0](https://nodered.org/).

This repository is now archived. It should still work with older versions of Node-RED, but I won't be continuing support for older versions, I hope you understand!
